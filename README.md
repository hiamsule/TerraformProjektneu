**Projekt 1**

**Project Name:** "Managing AWS EC2 with Terraform"

**Project Objectives:**

1. Learn how to create and manage an EC2 instance in AWS.

2. Automate infrastructure using Terraform and manage it with code.

3. Understand essential AWS features like security groups, key pairs, private keys, and Elastic IPs.

4. Learn about monitoring and security measures when creating an AWS EC2 instance.

**Project Steps:**

1. **Preparing the Project Infrastructure:**

   - Create an AWS account or use an existing AWS account.
   - Create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets in AWS.

2. **Setting Up the Terraform Environment:**

   - Install Terraform on your computer.
   - Configure AWS credentials to interact with AWS.

3. **Creating the Terraform Configuration File:**

   - Create a Terraform configuration file named `main.tf`.

4. **Creating the EC2 Resource:**

   - Define a resource in the Terraform configuration file that creates an EC2 instance. This resource should have the following properties:
     - Instance Type
     - Key Pair
     - Security Groups
     - Key Pair
     - Assignment of a private IP or Elastic IP

5. **Creating the EC2 with Terraform:**

   - Use Terraform commands to create the EC2 instance.

6. **Managing and Updating with Terraform:**

   - Use Terraform to manage and update your EC2 instance.

7. **Security and Monitoring:**

   - Take appropriate security measures to secure your AWS EC2 instance, such as configuring security groups and authentication settings.
   - Use AWS CloudWatch or monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your EC2 instance.

8. **Learning and Improvement:**

   - Review documentation and resources to understand and improve the actions and configurations done with Terraform throughout the project.

Once you complete this project, you will have gained basic Terraform skills, learned how to create and manage AWS EC2 instances, and acquired knowledge about security and monitoring. This 
project serves as a foundation for exploring more complex scenarios and further development.
